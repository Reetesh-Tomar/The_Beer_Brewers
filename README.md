# The_Beer_Brewers-

1)Introduction:

  a)The project is mainly based on html, CSS, JS, and bootstrap.
  b)Alert-- The problem statement of the beer brewers gives us a joyful opportunity to solve a real life problem. Our website is useful to give instant temperature sense 
    report of all the containers loaded inside the truck full of beers to be transported across the country, therefore ensuring the safety of the beers. Moreover, if a 
    new container is added, then we can also detect its temperature and instantly show it to the truck driver.
  c)Temperature sense- For this purpose, we need to put temperature sensors inside each container to check and transfer the data in the interval of let's say  1 minute.


2)Instructions to run:

  a)Simply click on the buttons given on each pages, to operate through the webpage.
  b)Add Container working- With the help of add container button we will directly move to the add container webpage. On the add container page, just fill up the 
    details given on the form inside it and click on save button. A new container will be added to the scan menu of our page.
  c)Scan Container working- with the help of scan container button we will directly move to the scan container webpage. On the scan container page, just click on
    the scan button, to check the status of each container inside our truck as many time as you need. Once our transportation is completed, we can simply move back
    to our home page by clicking on back button.
    
3)Assumption:

    Current temperature sense- For this purpose, I am assuming that since beer bottles are kept at very low temperature, usually below 10 degree Celcious, therefore I 
    am applying random function to give current temperature values between 0-10C, and if we get a current temperature value out of our max and min range of containers, we 
    will simply display either ALERT or SAFE (also their respective colours) for repective conditions. Moreover, I can also make the whole backend process using 
    temperature sensors and UNO, but it will surely took some more time to build.
   
4)Enhancement if I could have more time-

  a)First of all instead of making the whole process little static, I could have maked it fully dynamic and more creative like we solve a real world problem.
  b)I could have created a database for our scan container webpage, by applying concepts of backend and SQL.
  c)In such small time it was little difficult to arrange the temperature sensor and code them to make it use with our webpage for the demo purpose. 
  d)I could have also enhance the look of the webpage, by applying some more frontend concepts and using GUI's as a cream on cake.
  e)More options could be added inside our webpage to give our user a non-struggling freedom such as search bars, drop down menus, etc to give user friendly look.
